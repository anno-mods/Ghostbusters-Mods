  "Description": {
    "Chinese": null,
    "English": "Adds a new steam based Warship with custom mesh and textures for the player to be build in the Steam Shipyard when reaching 3000 Investors.\n    The design features high hitpoints and damage ratings, but rather slow movement. It's like a real beefy Battleship, and not a 'cruiser'.\n    \n    Stats: 12000 Health\n           84 Range\n           110 DPS\n           770 Damage Per Shot\n           7 Seconds Reload\t\n           8 Speed\n    Cost:  115 Steel\n           60 High Caliber Guns\n           50 Steam-Engines\t\n           20 Brass\n           24 Influence\n           1875 Maintenance\n    \n    The strength of the Battleship is to counter large ships and is more vulnerable against small ships like monitors.\n    So Battleship defeats Battlecruisers which defeats Monitors that could defeat a Battleship when in larger numbers.\n    This choice was made to give this Ship a balance, otherwise it would just replace every other ship. Its still a very very strong Ship.\n    \n    Mesh completely custom made in blender.\n    Most of the textures are custom made in Substance Painter and a few are modified original Files from Anno 1800.",
